Just some music I like to make sometimes.

All of these so far are prepared with the libre/gratis DAW [LMMS][lmms] version
[1.2.2][ver], their latest stable as of this writing. Yes, it's very old, and
[their tip][lmms-gh] has quite a lot more features--I'm using the lowest common
denominator for compatibility's sake. For the same reason, I'm avoiding any
plugin or sample that doesn't come with this version :)
