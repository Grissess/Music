Just some music I like to make sometimes.

All of these so far are prepared with the libre/gratis DAW [LMMS][lmms] version
[1.2.2][dl], their latest stable as of this writing. Yes, it's very old, and
[their tip][lmms-gh] has quite a lot more features--I'm using the lowest common
denominator for compatibility's sake. For the same reason, I'm avoiding any
plugin or sample that doesn't come with this version :)

You could render these yourself, but I also put them up on [Bandcamp][bc] and
[Soundcloud][sc] for your listening pleasure.

## Versioning (a.k.a. "what are all the numbers?")

All the pieces here are named in order of their creation; the (first) number
after "a" serves as the definitive reference number (let's call it the *song
number*). When first saved, I usually give a description of what I was studying
at the time (e.g. "[a study in] melody", "rhythm", etc.), or "test" if I can't
think of anythin more specific. There are exceptions to the rule; "peace" was
named for a poem. I hesitate to call these a "song name", or "track title", or
what-have-you; if I make a proper compilation, I might make real names for
them.

Song numbers are ascending, but you won't see the full set in this repo--most
of these little "studies" don't get anywhere interesting. (As of this writing,
maybe 1 in 10 make the cut.)

If there's a dash and another number as a suffix, those are versions--as LMMS
recognizes them with the "Save as New Version" action. I usually cut a new
version if the old one has been "satisfactory" for a long enough time to be
"established", in some sense, but I decide I want to tinker with it anyway
(usually with some retrospect). *Within* a version, though, I reserve the right
to change things at any time if it's still "in progress"--the highest song
number might do this several times!

The recording you find on [Bandcamp][bc] is likely to be the latest edit of the
latest version; if you want previous versions, you probably have to render from
this repository. There are a few songs that predate Git, in which case I've
lost the records--sorry!

## Contributions

I'm hosting these mostly for illustrative purposes, so anyone can not only
listen to, but learn from, how these pieces were put together. You're welcome
to build on these--that's a freedom protected by the CC-BY-4.0 license! But
whereas software is usually a collaborative effort, I intend this to be a
repository of music *by me*, so that I retain the sole copyright. By all means,
send me comments, feedback, advice, or even beer, but don't feel sore if I
close pull requests :)
